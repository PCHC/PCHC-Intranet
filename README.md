# PCHC Intranet

Development and design of [PCHC](http://pchc.com/)'s intranet website. Not sure if we'll be going the WordPress route, but it's a start.

Temporary in-development website can be found [**here.**](http://dev.cv-designs.com/pchc-intranet/) 

_Note: This can only be accessed from inside the PCHC network_

### Where the heck are the theme files?

Through the magic of git submodules, the master theme and child theme are simply references of commits on other repositories. No sense in managing the same code more than once.

### What are the themes based on?

The master and child themes are based on [Reverie](https://github.com/milohuang/reverie) and[Reverie Child](https://github.com/milohuang/reverie-child), which themselves are based on [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

### Surely you can't be serious?

I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.
